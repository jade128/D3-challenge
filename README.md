  a scatter plot was generated between two of the data variables such as healthcare vs. poverty or smokers vs. age using the D3 techniques. circle element and state abbreviation in the circle represent each state in the scatter plot. Tooltips were added to the scatter plot to display data that the user has selected by incorporating the d3-tip.js. Three labels for each axis were created, users can decide which data to display by clicking label in each axis.
